### Overview

It's well known that there is an important distinction between waking up and actually getting up.  
_Fighting My Demons_ helps motivate those who have trouble getting out of bed to refrain from snoozing their alarms and
going right back to sleep.  
This alarm app built with the Pygame framework requires the player to complete a card matching game to defeat a demon
and
shut off the alarm. The game is designed to provide sufficient mental stimulation to dispel morning drowsiness.
