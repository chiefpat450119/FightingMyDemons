“Fighting My Demons,” helps motivate people who have trouble waking up to not snooze their alarm and go back to bed. “Fighting My Demons” is an alarm app that requires the player to complete a card matching game to defeat a demon and shut off the alarm. We built this app using Python and Pygame, and used Figma for the assets. In the future, we intend to port the game into a mobile app and add more gamemode options, music, animations, and accessibility options.
